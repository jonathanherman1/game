## General
- All gameplay is orthogonal (no diagonals).
- Only one piece or token per space.
- No piece can ever move through another piece, even if on the same team.
- Exits are only accessible to baby raptors. Baby raptors must use "Move a baby raptor" action to escape.
- Wounded mother raptor loses movement based on the number of times she has been hit.
- Scientists have unlimited ammunition and fire.
  
### Determine Who Goes First Each Round
- Lower cards go first and perform a special action.
- Higher cards go second and perform a regular action(s). 
- The number of available regular actions is the difference of the card values.
  - For example, a card with a value of 2 and a card with a value of 6 were played. 
  - The player who played the card with 2 performs its special action. 
  - Now, 6 - 2 gives the other player 4 regular action points to use.

### Take Action!
- Each regular action for raptors and scientists costs ONE (1) action point.
- For determinining the number of actions you can take, see "Determining Who Goes First Each Round".
- Only active pieces can take actions.
- You can choose to not use regular actions.
- Only ONE (1) aggressive action (put to sleep, capture, or shoot) per scientist per round.
- Fire:
  - Raptors can never move to or through fire.
  - Scientists can move and shoot through fire, but cannot end their movement in fire.
  - When the mother raptor removes fire, all adjacent (connected) fire is removed.
  - When scientists drive a jeep through fire, it removes the fire.
- Frightened and Sleep:
  - Baby raptors cannot be revived the same round they were put to sleep.
  - Frightened scientists cannot be revived the same round they were frightened.
- Reinforcements (scientists):
  - Scientists have a fixed number of reinforcements; you can never receive more scientists than in your reserve.
  - Reinforcements can only be placed on the edge of the board, and never in the L-shaped tiles.
- Recovery (raptors):
